# Smart-Band
Smart Band,is basically a wearable electronic Band developed to avoid obstacle within pre-defined range.This Band would sense the obstacle around it and alert the person wearing it. Obstacle detection and warning can improve and make feasible the mobility as well as the safety of visually impaired people specially in unfamiliar environments. This project has four fundamental component: Adruino (a microcontroller), Ultrasonic Sensor(to detect obstacles),a buzzer(to produce sound)and power source. The working principle of the system is sensing the surrounding environment as well as detection of obstacles via Ultrasonic sensors and guiding and alerting the user by generating beep sound. This system is able to identify obstacle's position within the detection range.
